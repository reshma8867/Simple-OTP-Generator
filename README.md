# Simple OTP Generator

This is a clean and basic front-end tool designed to generate a 4-digit One-Time Password (OTP) upon a button click. It's a simple project built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript, ideal for demonstrating basic JavaScript math functions and DOM manipulation.

## ‚ú® Features

* Generates a new **4-digit number** on every click.
* Uses a robust, non-recursive method for number generation.
* Clean, modern, and centered UI using basic CSS.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Simple-OTP-Generator.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Simple-OTP-Generator.git)
    ```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Key JavaScript Logic

The OTP is generated by ensuring the random number is always between 1000 and 9999 (inclusive):

```javascript
let min = 1000;
let max = 9999;
let otp = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
